# COVID Email Automator
When vaccines were finally released during the COVID outbreak, pharmacies became very busy making appointments. This program automates that process by having the user input an excel file with names, email addresses, and first COVID appointment dates; having the user customize their email to be sent out, and automatically sending the email to each address with second COVID appointment dates.
- Leverage of Pandas for data manipulation, dateutil for date calculations, and Pythonâ€™s built-in smtplib and
email.message libraries for email sending
- Intuitive user instructions guide the process of uploading an Excel file with patient data, ensuring seamless data
integration
- Extracts patient names, emails, and vaccination dates from the uploaded Excel sheet, and utilizes dateutil to
calculate the corresponding second vaccine dates
- Dynamically creates personalized email content with appointment information, empowering healthcare professionals
to communicate effectively
- Incorporates error handling to identify and handle invalid email addresses, guaranteeing the successful delivery of
notifications
